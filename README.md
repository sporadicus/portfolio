# Hi there, I'm Ian!

Here you'll find some portfolio-type projects that i’ve whipped up recently--this little group of projects has only one purpose in life: to provide you, dear reader, with some recent examples of my coding, so thanks for taking a peek!

Each project is introduced by a bit of human-readable (i hope) prose giving some relevant (i hope) context to the project. If you have any questions that aren’t answered here, please feel free to just ask me.

## Faux-gan’s Alley

Nintendo’s NES console launched in the US in 1985 along with 17 games. Among those day-one release games was [Hogan’s Alley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogan%27s_Alley_(video_game)), which utilized a “light gun” accessory to simulate shooting cardboard cutouts of gangsters in a target range. As a coding exercise, I’m currently re-implementing one of the game’s three modes within a web interface.

Given that most people are unlikely to have a web-connected light gun, (and to avoid wading into heated discussions around adjacent subject matter) I’ve internally changed the theme of the game to a variation of [tag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(game)) in which the player’s goal is to ‘tag’ gangster targets by clicking or tapping on them.

If you want to get a feel for the original game, you can [play a web-based emulator](https://www.retrogames.cc/nes-games/hogan-s-alley-world.html) (which uses the original ROMs), or [watch some hot, on-console Hogan’s Alley playthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVRp0v_Tb9c) action.
